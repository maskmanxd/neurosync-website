					<p class="mt-4 mb-5">TMS therapy is a safe and effective outpatient treatment that utilizes magnetic pulses to stimulate 
                        inactive parts of the brain. It utilizes electromagnetic fields generated by specially designed coils to safely reach deep 
                        brain structures and influence neural activity. It is a non-invasive and non-pharmacological approach, often used when 
                        traditional antidepressant medications have failed to produce satisfactory results for the patient.

                        TMS therapy does not require any surgical procedures or skin puncturing, and it is painless. Patients have 
                        reported only minor side effects, such as mild scalp discomfort at the treatment site and headaches, which are 
                        generally managed with over-the-counter pain medication. These side effects typically resolve within the first week 
                        of treatment.</p>
