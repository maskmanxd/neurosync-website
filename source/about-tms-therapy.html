                <p class="text-med">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation therapy is a non-invasive,
                    FDA-approved treatment for depression and other mental
                    health conditions. TMS therapy uses magnetic fields to
                    stimulate nerve cells in the brain, which can alleviate
                    symptoms of depression and improve overall mood. </p>
                <p class="text-med">The treatment involves placing a small magnetic coil against
                    the scalp, which sends targeted magnetic pulses to the
                    brain. These pulses can help regulate activity in certain
                    areas of the brain associated with depression, anxiety, and
                    other mood disorders.</p>
                <p class="text-med">TMS therapy is a promising treatment option for individuals
                    struggling with depression particularly those who haven't
                    found relief with traditional treatments.
                    Unlock a brighter tomorrow with TMS therapy and rediscover
                    your zest for life.</p>

                <p class="text-med"> If you've been struggling with depression, anxiety, or other
                    negative mental health symptoms and haven't found relief
                    with traditional treatments such as medication or therapy,
                    TMS therapy may be a good option.</p>

                <p class="text-med"><b>Non-Invasive:</b> TMS therapy is a non-invasive treatment
                    that
                    does not require surgery or anesthesia, making it a safer
                    and less intrusive option for individuals seeking help with
                    their mental health.</p>

                <p class="text-med"><b>Effective:</b> TMS therapy has been shown to be an
                    effective
                    treatment for depression and other mood disorders, with
                    studies indicating that it can significantly improve
                    symptoms in a majority of patients.</p>

                <p class="text-med"><b>Minimal Side Effects:</b> TMS therapy is associated with
                    few
                    side effects, which typically include mild discomfort at the
                    site of stimulation or a mild headache.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 text-med">
                <p class="text-med">The electromagnetic pulses used in TMS Therapy are
                    non-invasive and painless as they pass through the scalp to
                    stimulate nerves beneath. The strength of the pulses can be
                    adjusted to achieve the desired result. The electromagnetic
                    pulses used in TMS therapy cause neurons in the brain to
                    fire faster and more frequently. </p>
                <p class="text-med">This electromagnetic stimulation increases brain activity,
                    resulting in improved cognitive functioning, increased
                    energy levels, and improved mood. TMS therapy has very few
                    side effects and is covered by most insurance providers,
                    making it an affordable option for many.</p>

                    <p class="text-med">TMS therapy, or transcranial magnetic stimulation, is a
                        type of brain stimulation therapy that uses
                        electromagnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in the brain
                        which are responsible to regulating mood. This

                        It's a noninvasive treatment, meaning it doesn't require
                        surgery or anesthesia.</p>

                    <p class="text-med">Generally, individual sessions can take anywhere from 30
                        – 40 minutes. We usually recommend for patients to
                        receive five treatments a week for about 4 – 6 weeks.
                        However, it's important to note that every patient is
                        different, and some may need different lengths of
                        sessions and/or courses. Your treatment can also differ
                        based on the TMS device that is being used.</p>
